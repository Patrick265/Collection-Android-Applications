## Hue App
This is a android application that lets you control hue lights of Philips. You can categories lights, give them a name and change the color of that particulair light.
The data is retrieved/changed with an API.

## Runkeeper
This android application is similair to Strava. It will track your location while doing a sportactivity, and shows the path you followed. That path will contain information about how fast you ran over several sections.
Besides that it als shows the current weather with the help of the openweather API. For the location tracking we used the Google Maps API, and to store all of the user data we used a SQLite database.
